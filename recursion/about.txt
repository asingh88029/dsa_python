Recursion is nothing, just a technique to solve a problem by function calling
itself approach.

1. Why function call itself?
Ans: To shorter the approach to find the sollution.

2. What is the maths behinds the recursion?
Ans: Recursion uses concept of PMI for solving problem.
We have to consider the bare minimum condition for every recursion approach.

3. How we can increase the recursion depth in python?
Ans:  It can be increased by sys module method sys.setrecursionlimit
